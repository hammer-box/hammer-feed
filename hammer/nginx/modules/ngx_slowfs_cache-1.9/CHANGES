2012-04-24    VERSION 1.9
    * Fix issue in which "copy once" fail-safe would be removed
      if (misbehaving) client would disconnect before cache update
      of an expired file was completed.

2012-02-28    VERSION 1.8
    * Fix setting of slowfs process title.
      In case when local path was over 277 characters long, slowfs
      process would crash, which would result in file not being
      copied to the cache.
      Bug had appeared in version 1.7.

2012-02-28    VERSION 1.7
    * Fix on-disk cache size calculation.
      Since the initial release, recorded on-disk cache size was
      decreased twice for purged content (once during cache purge
      and once during subsequent cache update).
      This resulted in recorded on-disk cache size being much
      smaller than in reality, which could lead to on-disk cache
      outgrowing defined "max_size" parameter.
      Patch from Pyry Hakulinen (via ngx_cache_purge, months ago).

    * Append path of the file being cached to the slowfs process
      title.

2011-05-03    VERSION 1.6
    * Fix compatibility with nginx-1.0.1.
      Reported by Sergey A. Osokin.

2011-04-21
    * Stop doing sanity checks when module isn't enabled.
      Reported by Tobi Tamas.

    * Fix build for nginx-0.7.66+.

2010-05-25    VERSION 1.4
    * Fix build for nginx-0.8.38+.
      Patch from Sergey A. Osokin.

2010-01-18    VERSION 1.3
    * Add missing cast, apparently some systems had trouble
      building module without this.
      Reported by Serhan Sevim.

2009-12-29    VERSION 1.2
    * Enable caching of 0 byte files in nginx-0.8.31+.

      (this includes 0.7.x line).
      Reported by Sergey A. Osokin.

    * Initial release
